👋 Hi, I’m @ZohrehRazavi
👩🏻‍💼 I'm a project manager in the software sector, but my passion for technology has led me to pursue a degree in Software Engineering at Bogazici.
👩🏻‍💻 I'm currently diving into Java, knowing there's a long road ahead, but I'm enthusiastic about learning.
💻 I also have some familiarity with HTML, CSS, and basic knowledge of Python.
🌱 I’m committed to expanding my technical skills while leveraging my experience in project management.
